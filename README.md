# Java-CrashCourse
This is a Java crash course.

I've divided it into an introduction, basic concepts, object oriented concepts, and gave a practice code I made that encapsulates most topics.

It's more to get a strong base into the language.

To access the actual code, go to any folder > src > com > company > Main.java

I recomend using IDEs Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA CE.
